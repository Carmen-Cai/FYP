# FYP
## This Project includes two parts:
1. The ECG Waveform Extraction Tool: to extarct waveforms from ECG PDF Reports 
2. The GAA-CNN model: to generate ECG waveforms and conduct basic diagnosis from ECG Paper Reports 

## The datasets used: (train:val:test= 8:1:1) Saved in Google Drive.
1. ECG PDF Reports (cropped) (975)
2. Extracted ECG PDF Waveforms (975)
3. Digitized ECG Paper Reports for the GAA (975)
4. Digitized ECG Paper Reports for the CNN (172)

The datasets have been split in advanced and saved in 'GAA data' and 'CNN data' respectively, regarding the purpose.

### Addresses for each split dataset:
1. GAA training:/FYP_Yixin_Cai/GAA_data/train/

## The codes written: Saved in Github.
1. The ECG Waveform Extraction Tool (PyCharm)
2. The GAA-CNN model (CoLab)
