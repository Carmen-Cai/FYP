# FYP
## This Project includes two parts:
1. The ECG Waveform Extraction Tool: to extarct waveforms from ECG PDF Reports 
2. The GAA-CNN model: to generate ECG waveforms and conduct basic diagnosis from ECG Paper Reports 

## The datasets used: (train:val:test= 8:1:1)
1. ECG PDF Reports (cropped) (975)
2. Extracted ECG PDF Waveforms (975)
3. Digitized ECG Paper Reports for the GAA (975)
4. Digitized ECG Paper Reports for the CNN (172)

## The codes written:
1. The ECG Waveform Extraction Tool (PyCharm)
2. The GAA-CNN model (CoLab)
