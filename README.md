# FYP
##This repository includes two parts:
1. The Singal Extracting method: to extarct waveforms from ECG PDF Reports (PyCharm)
2. The GAA-CNN model: to generate ECG waveforms and conduct basic diagnosis from ECG Paper Reports (CoLab)

##The datasets used for training this FYP projects: (train:val:test= 8:1:1)
1. ECG PDF Reports (cropped) (975)
2. Extracted ECG PDF Waveforms (975)
3. Digitized ECG Paper Reports (975)
